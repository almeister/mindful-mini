# My Impressions of the Website

Um, does someone at MM know Olivia Coleman? Can we get Ali-G to do a follow-up?

Mindful Money is a really useful collection of resources for searching and scrutinizing funds and learning about ethical investment.

As well, I noticed that the site is largely focused on "making their sins transparent", which probably makes decision-making easy for some people. I tend to think in grey rather than black and white, or in other words, I'm an over-thinker. My take is that the site is missing more "glass half full" perspectives so I'm incorporating some of that thinking.

I'm not sure which groups the target audience is comprised of so I'll do my best to frame the problem we are trying to solve:

"Ethical investment is complex and overwhelming."

A lack of clear information about funds and company ethical behaviour is at least part of the problem.

If that is the problem, I'll use the question below to begin my research:

"How can we make ethical investment easy and satisfying?"

# Design Plan

## Caveats

I worked on medical devices and games so I'm brining a product perspective to this plan. I'm guessing we want to avoid manipulative monetization features ðŸ˜‰

I'm primarily a developer with some experience in user / customer research and user experience design.

The ideas and recommendations for the design are based on my impressions and tastes. The real design would be a collaborative effort involving the teams' and users' feedback.

## User Experience

Use customer / user research to identify common pain points (eg: "There is a lack of information about x."). This comes from workshops, user interviews, search analytics tools like Glimpse and scraping social media resources like youtube comments.

Use common pain points to discover opportunities to help the users, eg: Make ethical investment easier.

Identify and double-down on the niche audience groups. Design features with their perspectives and feedback in mind.

## Testing

Gather and use feedback from users to iterate on design. eg: through UI tracking, workshops and testing sessions.

Open communication channels for feedback like a Discord server and an Issue tracker for reporting issues and requesting new features.

Prioritise common user feature requests and engage with users about progress, eg: on Discord, through email news letters.

Leverage AB Testing with new features to measure improvement metrics.

# Recommendations

## User Interface

Simplify the Fund Checker by reducing text and clutter on this page. Address accessibility considerations like font size, type, spacing and contrast.

Add more interactivity through tool tips, eg: pressing on the stacked bars in a chart presents a small list of transgressing companies with links to more details. Filtering of funds by ethical concerns is another idea.

## Personalisation

Giving users the option to login and store a profile might increase engagement and reduce churn. Features could centre around MM becoming a platform for measuring and tracking users' "investment health". Investment Health being a total score or alignment with ethical concerns. Health could simply be the total percentage of ethical funds (100 - totalConcerns) or it could be the spread of their multiple investments in mindful / impact / other investments. Users could set a health goal to work towards.

Features could include:

1. Authenticated login including connection to google, possibly RealMe.
2. Onboard users to complete a profile with;
    * Selection of their closely-held ethical concerns. It could use a quiz to assess values / morals.
    * Current investments.
3. A home page that shows the current health of their investments. Alignment with concerns or spread.
4. Highlight concerns in current investments.
5. Recommended funds based on user profile. Compare and contrast with current funds and show possible health gains.
6. Followed funds - a page for tracking and comparing ethical concerns of funds which they select.
    * Include impact stories.
    * Include total global investments in funds so that users can see the monetary value of funds (to provide visability of fund popularity).
    * Visual comparison of fund health / ethical concerns and monetary scale.
7. Alerts or notifictions on current and followed funds. Have funds improved or have they been naughty?
8. Investment portfolio goals, could include;
    * Health across all investments.
    * Exclusion or alignment of profiled ethical concerns, presented with award badges.

## Educational Content

I see that MM already does a lot of workshops and press releases. The following ideas are meant to drive engagement with the app as a tool for learning.

1. More informative interactivity elements like tool tips on the key / legend of the Fund Checker page.
2. Short, snappy text and video guides (< 5 mins).
3. An introductory course with short daily content and quizes.
4. A news board with articles on impact investments and companies held in mindful, impact and popular funds.
5. An Impact tab on the Fund Details page with links and stories about ethical companies held.

## Other Ideas

1. Score funds based on portfolio.
2. Top 10 or All funds with 98 % ethical investments news articles.
3. Other glass half full visualisations like "This fund is in the top 5 % of ethical invesments."
