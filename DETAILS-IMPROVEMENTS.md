# Future Improvements for the Details Page

1. Keep text to a minimum for Summary sections (eg: Fund Details, Ethical Investment, Avoiding Harmful Companies).
2. Instead of text, use more interactive elements like Ethical Investment badges with clickable tooltips.
3. Run an accessibility-checker like Wave on it to see how it stands up and make improvements.
4. I optimised layout for mobile first (only) and it looks pants on desktop. Make the layout and text look better on desktop.
5. My build needs a lot of improvement for mobile users - I'd replace the separate Fund Summary / Actual Investment Charts and Concerns sections with a page that shows the highlights with less text, more visuals. Then use buttons to show the rest.
6. A more modern colour theme.
7. More interactive visual elements like a gauge for ethical scores or health.
